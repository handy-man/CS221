Please add your skype username, for those not in the meeting we will hopefully be using skype to communicate over the christmas break.

If skype proves difficult/ not plausible we will instead use Teamspeak3, i already run a TS3 server so that will be no problem.

Remember that both of these applicaions can be used on most smartphones if you lack a microphone/ think that's a better option.
