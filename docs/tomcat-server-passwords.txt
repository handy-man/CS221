Hey all,

This file contains access to the TomCat server via FTP plus its location on the web etc.

The address for the Tomcat installation is as follows:

http://72.5.195.197

i have setup a domain address for this which is:

tomcat.thehiddennation.com

The FTP information is as follows to get into the entire Tomcat directory:

host: 72.5.195.150
username: tomcat
password: 3213560921*+*

tomcat asks for username and password information for its "manager" which is the following:

username: admin
password: 3213560921*+*

database connection information:

host www.thehiddennation.com
username handyman_group07
password 3213560921*+*
databasename handyman_monster
tables: player, player_friend, monsters

The database will not accept SQL commands from external IP addresses unless they're on the whitelist, this currently only lists the serverbox running the tomcat server.

thehiddennation.com website backend:

url: cpanel.thehiddennation.com
username: handyman
password: Kaz0huzb!*+*

Scroll down to the "phpmyadmin" section of the backend and that will re-direct you to access for the database, the database in question is handyman_monster. needless to say don't mess around with anything else, i'm giving this access out for use in the group project not to be broken and messed with. 

This is being run on a remote windows2008 server box, it is intended to handle all of our development/ interaction with other groups (if we even get that far).

There are some text examples running on the tomcat installation which seem to function just fine, so all should be good. I will try and work out exactly how we're going to run our own web application etc etc. 

thanks,

Nathan Hand.
