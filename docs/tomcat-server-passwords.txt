Hey all,

This file contains access to the TomCat server via FTP plus its location on the web etc.

The address for the Tomcat installation is as follows:

http://72.5.195.197

i have setup a domain address for this which is:

tomcat.thehiddennation.com

The FTP information is as follows to get into the entire Tomcat directory:

host: 72.5.195.150
username: tomcat
password: 3213560921*+*

tomcat asks for username and password information for its "manager" which is the following:

username: admin
password: 3213560921*+*

This is being run on a remote windows2008 server box, it is intended to handle all of our development/ interaction with other groups (if we even get that far).

There are some text examples running on the tomcat installation which seem to function just fine, so all should be good. I will try and work out exactly how we're going to run our own web application etc etc. 

thanks,

Nathan Hand.
