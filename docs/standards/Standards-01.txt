Store:

Breeding and trading can be in the same area under the idea of a "store" in which you can goto to trade and breed with friends.

Breeding:

Open offer to all friends which includes money to given to the person making the offer.
Money is set by the person making the offer so you can offer x amount of money and any friend can breed with you.
Breeding should only occur once then the offer dissapears (NOT CONFIRMED) 
one instance of breeding makes sense because then we can code Trading and Breeding in the same way, because a breed can only take place once.

Trading:

Open offer to all friends which includes money to be given to the person making the offer, money is set for the "trade/ sale" by the person making the offer.

Fighting:
A fight takes place like the following player1 offer's to fight player2 selecting which 2 monsters will fight there is also an amount of currency for the winner of the fight.
Both players put up that amount of money when the fight is accepted, and the fight takes place winner takes all. (so no creation of value from our monster stats)

other notes:

Get list of friends from server using rest?
pass all variabled through JSON
Same amount of money for all starting (how much?)
